# ðŸš€ GoFinances Web

Challenge to continue the development of the transaction management application, the proposed GoFinances
by Rpcketseat's Bootcamp. This application was made in React.js together with TypeScript,
using routes and sending files by form.

This application connects to the backend of [Challenge 06]
(https://github.com/tialaR/Desafio-GoStack-06-Database-Upload), 
displaying the transactions created and allowing the import of a CSV file to generate new records in the database.
